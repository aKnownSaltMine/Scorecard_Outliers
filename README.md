# Scorecard_Outliers
## Overview
The department was moving away from a relative stack rank that was used to coach agents. In place of that, they were given their "Scorecard." This is a method to guage agent performance against the company goals, which are reset every quarter. The aim of this was to allow agents to become more collabrative rather than competitive. Agent's were able to check their own scorecard progress through access of a web app, however, the aim of this report was to give visibility to the agent's scorecard to the agent's reporting hierarchy in order to monitor agent performance month over month in an Excel platform as requested. 

## Scorecard System
* Every quarter, the department would get performance goals for the metrics along with their weights. 
* There were three bands that an agent would be able to hit: 
    * Green if they were meeting goal 
    * Yellow if they were below goal but close 
    * Red if they were missing goal entirely
* There was also a fourth color, blue, that if the agent would hit above goal at the decided level, as well as hit a few other qualifications, the agent would be eligible for promotion.
